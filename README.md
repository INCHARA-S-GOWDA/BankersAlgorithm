# BankersAlgorithm
Problem Statement:- Design, develop and implement a C program to implement Bankerâ€™s algorithm.
Assume suitable input required to demonstrate the results

Description:- The Banker's algorithm is particularly important in preventing deadlock situations, where processes are unable to proceed because they are waiting for resources that are held by other processes. By using a conservative approach to resource allocation, the Banker's algorithm ensures that resources are allocated to processes in a way that avoids the possibility of deadlock.

The algorithm requires that each process must declare its maximum resource needs upfront and cannot exceed these declared limits during its execution. Additionally, the system must have information about the total available resources and the currently allocated resources to each process.
